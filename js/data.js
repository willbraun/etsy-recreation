          "Creeping Thyme ground cover, 1000 seeds, fragrant herb, pink blooms, perennial zones 4 to 9, sun or light shade, deerproof, Thymus serpyllum",
        description:
          "This miniature thyme is fragrant, pretty, and charming. It&#39;s also incredibly useful. Only 2&quot;-3&quot; tall, you can walk on it (releasing its lemony aroma), tuck it between pavers in a garden path, use it as a tidy border or fill in a flower bed. It grows quickly but isn&#39;t pushy, delivers texture, fragrance, and flowers, is great for cooking, and requires almost no care.\n\nA hardy perennial in zones 4-9, Creeping Thyme has a place in almost every garden. It cascades nicely in a rockery, fills in cracks, spills out of planters. In summer, it&#39;s covered with tiny pink blooms that attract honeybees and butterflies. It can be planted as a lawn that never needs mowing.\n\nCreeping Thyme thrives in full sun or light shade, well-draining soil, with occasional water. It blooms in late spring through early summer. The pink-purple blooms are so dense that they completely cover the foliage.  The rest of the year it&#39;s dense green. This is the most charming, versatile, and least demanding ground cover ever.\n\nPlants do not flower for the first two years!\n\nSurface sow the tiny seeds in a flat, keep them warm and moist, and in a sunny space.  USE A LIGHT MIST setting on your spray bottle/hose to water! Seeds are very tiny and too much pressure can dislodge them.   Place your flats in a warm, sunny spot.  Once ready, then tear off chunks of seedlings and plant them 6&quot; apart.  They&#39;ll fill in over time.  This much seed will cover about 25 square feet.  Four packs will cover about 100 square feet. Sixteen packs will cover 1000 square feet, about a half a pound. \n\n\n1000 seeds\n\n**********. With low availability of Creeping Thyme seeds, all sales are FINAL! **********\n\nIf you need 4 packs or more, check out our Creeping Thyme Bulk Pack: www.etsy.com/your/shops/SmartSeeds/tools/listings/256751922\n\n**All seeds ship for one price!

        description:
          "What fun will be had!!! Plant them, see them grow, right in front of your eyes!!! \n\nOxalis palmifrons is a low-growing perennial with stunning foliage, which is quite unlike any other Oxalis. The slow-spreading patch of ground-hugging rosettes spreads up to 2 feet (60 cm) in 10 years. Each symmetrical rosette is composed of glaucous green, 3-dimensional, miniature palm-like leaves. This plant is a winter grower that does not emerge until late fall, when it is topped with stalks of light pink flowers held just above the foliage. It remains evergreen all winter, finally going dormant when the heat of summer arrives.\n\nGreat gifts for everyone! Science experiments, home-school projects and great for party favor gift bags too! Please message me for a bulk discount. Seeds should be stored in a cool dry place.\n\n~ Includes ~\n\n~Quantity of Seeds, ranging from 5~20 (your choice). \n\n~ Grow and Care Instructions, for your new babies!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc95Custom Orders are always welcomed, please message me!\n\nAlso, check out the rest of my Shop: https://yourplantbitch.etsy.com",

        title: "Black Magic Sunflower, 15 Seeds, Helianthus Annuus",
        description:
          "The closest to black you can get in a sunflower.\nColors vary from black to bronze with occasional touches of maroon. Cross pollination is high in sunflowers, in particular. \n\nReaches 4 feet tall. Blooms are 5 inches across. \n\nPlant in late spring or summer in cooler climates and any time of year in zones 9+. These can handle some heat but so appreciate being well irrigated. \n\nSunflowers are a great way to attract bees to your garden as they find them irresistible and will pollinate everything else while visiting, yielding you more flowers and vegetables throughout your garden.\n\nAnnual that can be grown in any climate from spring to late summer as sprout to flower is only 90 days. These can be planted any time of year in zones 9B+\n\nThis is for 15 Non GMO seeds.\n\nI combine shipping on all seed orders, you pay one flat fee for as many seeds as you would like for no additional shipping. Orders over $35 for any combination of items in my shop ship for free! \n\nAll of my seeds are tested and guaranteed. Most of my seeds are fresh off of my own plants. Please see below for detailed planting instructions. The very last photo of the listing is a printable version that you can print from your desktop by simply pressing and holding CTRL and then P. \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nChoose a location that gets full sun. Plant when temperatures are between 60 and 90 degrees. Keep well irrigated in extreme heat.  These look best planted in a row in the back of a garden bed as they get 6-7 feet tall. These are sprout to flower 60-90 days. Dig down a few inches into the soil and refill with organic compost, garden soil or a mixture of both. The farther you dig, the happier and healthier the sunflowers will be. I like to dig down about 6 inches around where I am planting each seed.  Plant seeds \u00bd to 1 inch deep. Space the seeds 12-18 inches apart.\n\nWater daily until they sprout and then continue to water as needed. These are heavy feeders and like to be fertilized. I use organic fertilizer for organic gardening, look for a fertilizer that is lower in nitrogen and higher in phosphorus and potassium such as 5-10-10 (N-P-K.) It\u2019s not the numbers that matters so much as the ratio of numbers. You want half the amount of nitrogen as you do the other two, particularly phosphorus. Most fertilizers that are primarily for bloom boosting or flowering plants will suffice.  Higher Phosphorus (P) will give you more abundant and larger blooms, too much nitrogen (N) will make them too leafy and less flowery. Plus, sunflowers are adept at finding nitrogen in the soil by spreading their roots up to five feet underground! Follow the instructions on the package. \n\nSome experts like to use borax as a source of boron which can give you a 20% increase in blooms and bloom size. Prior to blooms opening, when buds are just halfway developed, mix \u00bd teaspoon of borax and mix until it is fully dissolved in a gallon of water and pour it at the base of the plants being careful not to get it on the foliage. You want to do this in the morning. Repeat one month later if desired. This is also a deterrent for pests.\n\nIf your climate is particularly windy or the sunflower heads grow particularly large, you may want to stake them. You can judge as they grow and see if staking is needed. \n\nNote: Sunflowers have a very high germination rate. It is very unusual for them not to sprout. If they don\u2019t, this is almost always due to squirrels, chipmunks or even raccoons! Squirrels bury acorns for future use and have such powerful noses that they are able to sniff them out later. They are just as easily able to sniff out a tasty sunflower seed. If you have a lot of squirrels in your yard, especially if you have a feeder for them or for birds, you may want to start the seeds in a starter tray and put them in a very bright, preferably southern or western facing window that gets direct sun. After they sprout, plant them in the ground as described above.\n\nA NOTE ON SEED STORAGE:\nIf your temperatures are not quite right for planting, you can keep the seeds viable by keeping them in the plastic bag that I send them in (which is thick and food grade for specifically this purpose,) place that in a paper bag to block light and put it in your refrigerator until you are ready to plant. This can be done with most all seeds and will keep them viable for 1-5 years depending on the species.  If you have a basement, you can store them there as well. A sealed mason jar in a paper bag is also ideal. The key for seed storage is cool, dark and dry.",

        title: "Chocolate Cherry Sunflower, 25 Seeds, Helianthus Annuus",
        description:
          "By far the most beautiful sunflower I\u2019ve ever personally grown. I love flowers that are colors that aren\u2019t typical of their species.\n\nThese are aptly name and are a rich reddish brown with a dark center. The petals glow red in the sunlight. \n\nNot only is this an impressive flower but it\u2019s also impressive in size, with flower heads that are 5-8 inches across grown in stalks that are 6-7 feet tall. These are a flower to look up to in every way. \n\nPlant in late spring or summer in cooler climates and any time of year in zones 9+. These can handle some heat but so appreciate being well irrigated. \n\nSunflowers are a great way to attract bees to your garden as they find them irresistible and will pollinate everything else while visiting, yielding you more flowers and vegetables throughout your garden.\n\nAnnual that can be grown in any climate from spring to late summer as sprout to flower is only 90 days. These can be planted any time of year in zones 9B+\n\nThis is for 25 Non GMO seeds.\n\nI combine shipping on all seed orders, you pay one flat fee for as many seeds as you would like for no additional shipping. Orders over $35 for any combination of items in my shop ship for free! \n\nAll of my seeds are tested and guaranteed. Most of my seeds are fresh off of my own plants. Please see below for detailed planting instructions. The very last photo of the listing is a printable version that you can print from your desktop by simply pressing and holding CTRL and then P. \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nChoose a location that gets full sun. Plant when temperatures are between 60 and 90 degrees. Keep well irrigated in extreme heat.  These look best planted in a row in the back of a garden bed as they get 6-7 feet tall. These are sprout to flower 60-90 days. Dig down a few inches into the soil and refill with organic compost, garden soil or a mixture of both. The farther you dig, the happier and healthier the sunflowers will be. I like to dig down about 6 inches around where I am planting each seed.  Plant seeds \u00bd to 1 inch deep. Space the seeds 12-18 inches apart.\n\nWater daily until they sprout and then continue to water as needed. These are heavy feeders and like to be fertilized. I use organic fertilizer for organic gardening, look for a fertilizer that is lower in nitrogen and higher in phosphorus and potassium such as 5-10-10 (N-P-K.) It\u2019s not the numbers that matters so much as the ratio of numbers. You want half the amount of nitrogen as you do the other two, particularly phosphorus. Most fertilizers that are primarily for bloom boosting or flowering plants will suffice.  Higher Phosphorus (P) will give you more abundant and larger blooms, too much nitrogen (N) will make them too leafy and less flowery. Plus, sunflowers are adept at finding nitrogen in the soil by spreading their roots up to five feet underground! Follow the instructions on the package. \n\nSome experts like to use borax as a source of boron which can give you a 20% increase in blooms and bloom size. Prior to blooms opening, when buds are just halfway developed, mix \u00bd teaspoon of borax and mix until it is fully dissolved in a gallon of water and pour it at the base of the plants being careful not to get it on the foliage. You want to do this in the morning. Repeat one month later if desired. This is also a deterrent for pests.\n\nIf your climate is particularly windy or the sunflower heads grow particularly large, you may want to stake them. You can judge as they grow and see if staking is needed. \n\nNote: Sunflowers have a very high germination rate. It is very unusual for them not to sprout. If they don\u2019t, this is almost always due to squirrels, chipmunks or even raccoons! Squirrels bury acorns for future use and have such powerful noses that they are able to sniff them out later. They are just as easily able to sniff out a tasty sunflower seed. If you have a lot of squirrels in your yard, especially if you have a feeder for them or for birds, you may want to start the seeds in a starter tray and put them in a very bright, preferably southern or western facing window that gets direct sun. After they sprout, plant them in the ground as described above.\n\nA NOTE ON SEED STORAGE:\nIf your temperatures are not quite right for planting, you can keep the seeds viable by keeping them in the plastic bag that I send them in (which is thick and food grade for specifically this purpose,) place that in a paper bag to block light and put it in your refrigerator until you are ready to plant. This can be done with most all seeds and will keep them viable for 1-5 years depending on the species.  If you have a basement, you can store them there as well. A sealed mason jar in a paper bag is also ideal. The key for seed storage is cool, dark and dry.",

          "Mammillaria heyderi, 9 seedlings\n\nThe first picture shows the plants you will receive. They are shown in a 3&quot; pot, but will be shipped bare root. Other images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect. Each plant in the cluster has its own roots.\n\nM. heyder is a low-growing, flattened plant in habitat, often barely extending above ground level. In culture it tends to grow in a taller mound shape. In spring it sports a ring of cream-colored flowers that circle the crown of the plant. It commonly retains brilliant red fruits from the previous season while it is flowering. \n\nPlant them in a loose soil mix and water and feed regularly during the growing season with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example: perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria (black or red volcanic gravel and sand), pumice, topsoil and/or calcined clay products such as Turface. The rest can be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost or commercial cactus potting mix. This cactus prefers bright sunlight, but some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to at least 15\u00b0F if kept dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nSome info courtesy of www.llifle.com",

        description:
          "Mammillaria formosa, 2 plants\n\nThe first photo is of the plants you will receive. They are in a 2&quot; pot but will be shipped bare root. The other photos are to give you an idea what the mature plant and its flowers look like.\n\nM. boolii is a clumping plant with a pale green epidermis, up to 2&quot; in diameter in habitat but larger in cultivation. It has huge, pink flowers with darker pink midstripes that bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season if watered and fed regularly. Use a very loose mineral soil mix with little or no organic matter. Feed with a quarter-strength fertilizer during the growing season.\n\nYou can pot these seedlings together in a 4-5&quot; pot or you can separate them and pot individually, in which case I would recommend a 2-3&quot; pot. After potting do not water for 7-10 days to allow roots to heal since unhealed wet roots are susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. Keep young seedlings in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Plants should be acclimated gradually to full sunlight since they have been in a greenhouse for most of their lives.\n\nCacti are shipped using the most appropriate and protective packaging. Occasionally, they may suffer small nicks or broken spines but will heal as they grow and you likely won\u2019t remember where the damage was. After potting and a 7-10-day rest period, watering and feeding will help restore them to their normal vibrance and robustness.",

        description:
          "Mammillaria elegans, 9 seedlings\n(Mammillaria geminispina)\n\nFirst picture shows the plant(s) you will receive. They are shown in a 2&quot; pot, but will be shipped bare root. \nOther images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect.\n\nPlant them in a loose, fertile soil mix and water and feed regularly with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer during the growing season. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example, perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria, pumice, topsoil, and the rest can be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost. This cactus prefers bright sunlight, but some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to 20\u00b0F for a few hours. Keep dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nPlants are shipped bare root. Do not water for 7-10 days after potting to allow roots to heal. Keep in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Plants should be gradually acclimated to full sunlight since they have been in a greenhouse for most of their lives. You can pot these seedlings together in a 4&quot;-5&quot;&quot; pot or you can carefully separate them and pot individually, in which case a 3&quot;-4&quot; pot is recommended for each one.\n\nCacti are shipped using the most appropriate and protective packaging. Occasionally, they may suffer small nicks or broken spines but will heal as they grow and you likely won\u2019t remember where the damage was. After potting and a 7-10-day rest period, watering and feeding will help restore them to their normal vibrance and robustness.",

        title: "Grean-Headed Coneflower Essence",
        description:
          "Wildcrafted Appalachian Green-Headed Coneflower (Rudbeckia lanciniata) Flower Essence prepared in spring water and preserved in vodka.\nCreated in synchronization with moon cycles and astrological events. Feel free to inquire as to which astrological energies your order was made with.\n\nGolden Glow (Green-Headed Coneflower) supports us in our onward and upward journeys by helping us access wisdom that has previously been out of our reach and by expanding our conscious awareness of what we know. More specifically, Golden Glow is concerned with the nadis, points at which divine wisdom and prana energy can move in a coordinated disbursal throughout our energy system. The Angels suggest applying Golden Glow in a line from the top of the head down to the back of the neck, with a particular focus on placing the Essence on the back of the neck.\n\n\n\nAbout Essences:\nFlower essences are dilute, potentized herbal infusions or decoctions, prepared from wildflowers or pristine garden blossoms. They are made directly in the \u201claboratory of nature,\u201d where the four alchemical elements of earth, water, air and fire are found in harmonious balance. To this is added the fifth \u201cquintessential\u201d element of the sensitive awareness and attunement of the preparer. The fresh, dew-filled blossoms are gathered in the early morning of a clear, sunny day. Floating on the surface of a bowl of water, they are irradiated by the warmth and light of the sun for several hours. This process creates an energetic imprint of the etheric energy pattern of the flower in the water, embodying the healing archetype of that plant. This \u201cmother essence\u201d is preserved with organic alcohol and then further diluted and potentized to form the \u201cstock.\u201d\n\n\nAbout the Alchemist:\nI have an extensive background in mycology, botany, and biology, with a Bachelors in Biology from Stetson University. I have and do study with a number of mycology, taxonomy, and wildcrafting teachers, including Dr. Andrew Methven, Tradd Cotter, and Alan Muskat. I am Wild Mushroom Safety Certified.\nI am also a naturalist educator, with a primary focus on mycology, citizen science, natural healing, sustainability, and cultivation. Past collaboration include but not limited to: Past collaborations include but not limited to: Pasco EcoFest (Pasco County, Fl), Moccasin Lake Environmental Education Center (Clearwater, Fl), Windermere Organic Farms and Apiaries (Memphis, Tn), Georgia Mushroom Festival (Cave Springs, Ga), Kinnection Campout (Spirit Crossing, Tn), New Moon Mycology Summit (Wingdale, NY), Organic Growers School (Mars Hill, NC), No Taste Like Home (Asheville, NC).\n\nMore information on my website: www.aumanita.com",

It is shown in a 2&quot; pot, but may be shipped bare root. \nOther images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect.\n\nPlant in a loose, fertile soil mix and water and feed regularly with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer during the growing season. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example, perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria, pumice, topsoil) and the rest can be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost. This cactus prefers bright, but filtered sunlight, but some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to at least 25\u00b0F for a few hours. Keep dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nAfter potting do not water for 7-10 days to allow roots to heal. Keep young seedlings in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Plants should be acclimated gradually to full sunlight since they have been in a greenhouse for most of their lives.\n\nCacti are living things and may have minor imperfections which are not immediately seen.",

          "Sympathy Gift Box with Grief Affirmation Card Set for Lost Loved One",
        description:
          "Sympathy gift box with a set of grief affirmation cards and a succulent beautifully packaged with a personalized handwritten card and sent directly to the recipient. \n\nWhen someone you care for loses someone they love it can be hard to know what to say or do. This sympathy box not only provides a useful tool for someone grieving, it is a gorgeous and long lasting way to remind them you&#39;re there for them. \n\n\n\n---------------WHATS INCLUDED\n\n+Grief Affirmation Cards\n\nLosing someone you love is one of the hardest things someone goes through in their life. Grieving is a highly unique experience that has no time limit - sometimes we need these kind of reminders to help push us through another day.\n\nThis grief affirmation card set includes 20 cards, 16 affirmations and 4 quotes that can offer daily support and comfort to those who are grieving. \n\nThe 3in x 3.5in. cards are printed on cardstock and then laminated for extra durability. They come in a muslin carrying case so they can go with you wherever you go.\n\n+Succulent\n\nFlowers are great, but it&#39;s the go-to for most people trying to show their support. A succulent is not only a unique gift, it&#39;s hardy and will last forever. Succulents may vary from the listing pictures but all will be a 2&quot; rosette style in a terracotta pot.\n\n+Personalized Card\n\nA card with either &quot;with deepest sympathy&quot;, &quot;on the anniversary of&quot;, &quot;in memory of&quot; or &quot;sending love in your time of grief&quot; will be included inside your gift box. You can add an optional personalized message which will be handwritten on the backside. To do so, leave a message in the gift message field at checkout. If you choose to not leave a personal message, please at least include your name at checkout so the recipient knows who sent it. If you leave no message or name in the gift message field there will be no indicator as to who sent the box.\n\n\n\n------------- OPTIONAL ADD ONS\n\n+Hug Seed Packet\n\nInclude a virtual hug with 10 plantable paper hearts and an insert card to remind your loved one that you&#39;re thinking of them. The seed paper blooms into beautiful wildflowers. Directions are included.\n\n+Worry Stone\n\nAdd on an agate worry stone for your loved one to carry in their pocket and rub when they are feeling tense, sad, or anxious. Approximately 1&quot; in size. Stone colors will vary but will be hand selected for the recipient.\n\n+Starbucks Gift Card\n\nInclude a Starbucks gift card so your loved ones can grab a much needed breakfast or cup of coffee. Sometimes remembering to eat and practice self care in the wake of a loss is difficult, a gift card can be a gentle reminder. Gift card is for $20. Listed as Starbucks GC or GC at checkout.\n\n\n-------------PLEASE READ\n\nMESSAGES ----\n\nPlease make sure you write your gift message in the *gift message* field at checkout and not the note to seller. Select &quot;this is a gift&quot; at checkout and it will populate a &quot;gift message&quot; field where you should write your message. Please double check your message before sending. Due to the volume of orders we receive we cannot accept your message via Etsy Conversation - it needs to be written in the gift message field. Thank you.\n\nIf you do not have a message for the receiver please just write your name so they know who sent it to them. If you do not send a message or leave your name they will not know who the box is from. \n\nSHIPPING ----\n\nPlease, please double check the mailing address at checkout - sometimes your device will autofill with the incorrect address. We will ship to the address on the order and are not responsible if the order goes to the incorrect address. Due to the volume of orders we receive we cannot accept change of address via Etsy Conversations. We apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nIf you have any questions please reach out!\n\nThank you!\n\n\n------------- HOW TO CHECK OUT\n\n1. Add optional add-on&#39;s at check out\n2. Choose which card insert you want \n3. Add your personal gift message in the gift message field or leave your name so the recipient knows who sent it\n4. PLEASE double check the mailing address is correct for your gift recipient (sometimes they get autofilled with an incorrect address).\n\n\n\n------------- SHIPPING\n\nGift box is packaged inside of a sturdy shipping box. Succulents are packed with care, but you may find some loose dirt in the box upon arrival. All gift boxes are sent priority mail so the succulents spend the least amount of time in transit possible and your loved one gets the box quickly. Make sure to let your friend or family member know there is a live plant in their gift box so they know to open it as soon as they can.\n\nGift boxes are processed and shipped within 3 business days of purchase. \n\nNote: If you purchase express shipping it will expedite the USPS delivery time but it does not expedite the processing time (when the order ships). If you would like to expedite the processing time please see the rush option below.\n\n\n---RUSH OPTION\n\nIf you would like your box to be processed faster you can purchase the rush fee listing. We will ship your gift box before noon the next business day if your order is placed before 10pm EST Monday - Friday. This does not expedite shipping - it puts your order as priority for us to process. If you would like faster shipping please contact us for overnight rates. \n\nRUSH: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1008190872/rush-fee-for-sympathy-gift-box\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n-------------PERSONAL NOTE\n\nI lost my father to cancer in 2014 and thought I would never recover. My heart was broken into pieces and what was once normal grief snowballed into something called complicated grief. I felt stuck, misunderstood and needed affirmations to guide me everyday through my healing process. I&#39;m not healed yet, I don&#39;t think any of us ever completely heal, but I can say that the fact that I am able to type this out to all of you reading is a sign I&#39;m better than I was.\n\nI hope that the affirmation cards can offer some comfort and guidance for those of you who find yourselves heartbroken over the loss of a loved one.\n\n\n\n------------GRIEF CARDS LISTINGS\n\n\nONE SET OF GRIEF CARDS ----&gt; https://etsy.me/3tn5LcI\n\nNeed more than one set? Get a bundle of 3 or 6 at a discounted rate.\n\nBUNDLE OF THREE (3) -----&gt; http://etsy.me/3s8792L\n\nBUNDLE OF SIX (6) ------&gt; http://etsy.me/37ujpm9\n\n\n\n///\n\nIf you have any questions please reach out.\n\nThank you!",

          "Garlic Chive Herb Seeds - Open-Pollinated for Seed Saving - Non-Hybrid & Non-GMO - Canada Heirloom Herb Seeds",
        description:
          "We offer flat rate shipping: Only 3.99$ no matter how many seeds you order!\n\nCome and visit our Etsy shop to see more of our products - we offer next day shipping on over 100 varieties of heirloom and open-pollinated seeds.\n\nChive, Garlic\n\nGarlic chive is a classic herb loved by many. The Chinese have been cultivating and cooking it for at least 3,000 years and its popularity has long expended past its borders to be incorporated in many classic dishes from around the world. Quite easy to grow from seed as an annual during the cool season, garlic chive can also be turned into a hardy perennial if provided with some protection from the extreme cold weather. \n\nGarlic chives look like long flat green grass-like shoots, and they will reach about 2 feet tall at maturity. The plants will start to emit a mild garlic aroma when they reach about 6\u2019\u2019 tall. Their little white flowers are edible too, adding a nice subtle garlic flavour. Garlic chive is excellent fresh in many Asian saut\u00e9ed dishes or as a garnish on baked potatoes, just to name a few examples. They can also be dried for use during the winter months.

        description:
          "We offer flat rate shipping: Only 3.99$ no matter how many seeds you order!\n\nCome and visit our Etsy shop to see more of our products - we offer next day shipping on over 100 varieties of heirloom and open-pollinated seeds.\n\nParsley, Triple Moss Curled\n\nTriple Moss Curled parsley produces plants about 10-12 inches tall with a dense canopy of finely cut, deeply curled leaves with an aromatic flavour. This heat-tolerant variety is equally adaptable to both indoor and outdoor growing and can be harvested continuously during the growing season. Triple Moss Curled is more spectacular in the garden then the flat leaf varieties, and can be used fresh or dried for garnishing or culinary decoration. \n\n- Life Cycle: Biennial, often grown as an annual\n- Days to Maturity: 40-60\n- Canada Hardiness Zone: 6-9\n- Planting Depth: 5 mm\n- Plant Spacing: 30-40 cm\n- Growth Habit: 30-40 cm tall\n\n* These parsley seeds will remain viable for 1 year if stored in a cool, dark place, ideally between 4 and 10\u2070C.  After that, the germination rate may start to go down.\n\nYou know that a lush, fruitful garden needs good soil, frequent watering, and sunlight to grow, but it\u2019s the seeds that really make the harvest. All the seeds in this package are old-time heirlooms, meaning they have kept their true flavour profile and nutritional values.\n\nThe seeds are all-natural, non-GMO, non-hybrid, untreated, and open-pollinated for seed saving. Picked and bagged for 2022, these are also fresh seeds with high germination rates, so you can get started on your incredible natural garden right away!\n\nAll seeds come in resealable bags for safe storage: plant them all, germinate some indoors, save some for next season - it\u2019s up to you!\n\n--- For details on ordering, please read the below ---\n\nOur goal is to provide inspiration and education to gardeners by carrying only open-pollinated seeds, guaranteeing your ability to harvest and plant them year after year. Buying from Ecoseedbank is not only fun, but it is also a sustainable choice.\n\nWe believe that local food security, sustainability, and ethically sourced seeds are essential. With a strong belief in the need for agroecological biodiversity, we never stock hybrid or GMO seeds.\n\nAll of our seeds are sourced from ecologically sustainable farming operations and we carry only heritage seeds, which have been passed down through generations. You can be confident that you are supporting environmentally-friendly farming practices when you buy from Ecoseedbank.\n\nSHIPPING THE SAME OR NEXT BUSINESS DAY!\n\nCanada Post: Shipping flat rate of $3.99 no matter how many seeds you order!\n\nRegular orders ship via Canada Post Standard Mail in recyclable padded envelopes. Normal delivery time is 2-4 business days.\n\nOrders over 0.5kg ship with Canada Post Regular Parcel and a tracking number is provided. It may take up to 9 business days for you to receive your delivery.\n\nDue to the nature of our products, seed germination rates may vary depending on storage and growth conditions. Some varieties have a naturally low germination rate, such as Rosemary at around 50%. When a variety has a lower germination rate, it is usually indicated on the packet and we endeavour to provide more seeds to compensate. The vast majority of our seeds have germination rates of over 85%. We work hard to provide you with the best service possible.\n\nNo duties or import fees are charged when buying seeds between Canadian provinces. All of our seeds conform to Canadian Seeds Regulations under the Seeds Act, and have been tested for purity, germination, and noxious weeds by a government accredited lab.\n\nUnited States orders: We require US customers to mail us a copy of their \u2018import permit for small lot of seeds\u2019\u2019, and an additional prepaid shipping label for the USDA testing station in order for us to send the package to the shipping destination. We can provide a phytosanitary certificate and a seed analysis certificate upon request and at the buyer\u2019s expense. Shipping seeds through customs can be a delicate process. As such, we require all US buyers to contact us prior to placing an order with Ecoseedbank.\n\nSatisfaction 100% guaranteed. We accept returns and exchanges, no questions asked. Please contact us before returning your item so we can work out a solution that suits both parties. We accept cancellation of your order until your item has been marked as shipped.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback about one of our products or your order, feel free to contact us and we will get back to you quickly.\n\nFollow us on social media!

        description:
          "Gymnocalycium mendozaense, 3 seedlings\n\nFirst picture shows the plants you will receive. They are shown in a 3&quot; pot, but will be shipped bare root. Other images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect.\n\nGymnocalycium mendozaense is a relatively rare plant in cutivation. It resembles G. mihanovichii except that its ribs are less sharp and it has a smoother epidermis. Plant it in a loose, fertile soil mix and water and feed regularly during the growing season with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example, perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria, pumice, topsoil, and the rest should be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost. These ingredients will make the soil pH slightly acidic which is good for this genus. It does best in bright filtered sunlight, but some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to at least 15\u00b0F for a few hours. Keep dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nPlants are shipped bare root. After potting do not water for 7-10 days to allow roots to heal. Keep young seedlings in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Plants should be acclimated gradually to full sunlight since they have been in a greenhouse for most of their lives.\n\nCacti are shipped using the most appropriate and protective packaging. Occasionally, they may suffer small nicks or broken spines but will heal as they grow and you likely won\u2019t remember where the damage was. After potting and a 7-10-day rest period to let roots heal, watering and feeding will help restore them to their normal vibrance and robustness.",

          "THIS LISTING IS FOR A DIGITAL FILE, NOT A PHYSICAL/FINISHED PRODUCT.\n\nThis file includes seven designs in three sizes (6&quot;, 8&quot;, and 10&quot;). If you&#39;d like to make larger plant trellises, rotate the design 90 degrees and cut them sideways.\n\nThe more intricate trellises have lines that are a bit thin in the 6&quot; size, but should still cut and work fine. \n\nBe sure to coat your trellises in something to make them water resistant. I found that 5 layers of clear matte Plastidip spray worked great. \n\nFeel free to sell the finished products you make from my files, but do not sell or give away the files or any altered version of my files. If you&#39;re not sure if something is allowed, reach out and ask! I&#39;m happy to talk it over. \n\nI&#39;d love to see and share your photos!

Other images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect.\n\nPlant it in a loose, fertile soil mix and water and feed regularly with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer during the growing season. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example, perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria, pumice, topsoil) and the rest can be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost. This cactus prefers bright, but filtered sunlight, and some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to at least 25\u00b0F for a few hours. Keep dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nAfter potting do not water for 7-10 days to allow roots to heal. Keep young seedlings in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Plants should be acclimated gradually to full sunlight since they have been in a greenhouse for most of their lives.\n\nCacti are living things and may have minor imperfections which are not immediately seen.",

Other images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect.\n\nPlant in a loose, fertile soil mix and water and feed regularly with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer during the growing season. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example, perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria, pumice, topsoil) and the rest can be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost. This cactus prefers bright, but filtered sunlight, and some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to at least 25\u00b0F for a few hours. Keep dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nAfter potting do not water for 7-10 days to allow roots to heal. Keep young seedlings in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Plants should be acclimated gradually to full sunlight since they have been in a greenhouse for most of their lives.\n\nCacti are living things and may have minor imperfections which are not immediately seen.",

          "\ud83e\udeb4WELCOME!\n\n\u2022You will get the exact newly rooted plant shown on all the photos.\n\n\u2022It will ship in its 3\u201d starter pot.\n\n\u2022Listed:  5/17/22\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udeb4PLANT CARE SUGGESTIONS\n\n\u2022These plant should be potted in a well draining soil mix in a pot with a drainage hole. \n\n\u2022Hoyas are susceptible to root rot and should not sit in water. \n\n\u2022Allow plant to completely drain after watering and allow to dry out between waterings. \n\n\u2022Water when the top 2\u201d of the soil feels dry. \n\n\u2022These plants like bright, indirect light. \n\n\u2022Some direct light is okay, however, watch for leaf burn if plant receives too much direct light. \n\n\u2022These plants are humidity-loving plants, however, humidity is not required for plant survival.\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udeb4BUYER SELLER AGREEMENT\n\n\u2022You will receive the actual plant pictured or identical to it.\n\u2022It is a plant that I have been growing under my personal care and ready to ship. \n\u2022Please note any damages & imperfections. \n\u2022Photo before shipping is available upon request. \n\n\u2022I check all the plants prior to shipping and I do not ship the plant if it is not as described in the listing at the time of shipping. \n\n\u2022Please be aware that stress and damages to the plant can occur during shipping that may alter the appearance of the plant. \n\u2022This may include browning or yellowing of the leaves, bent leaves and rot on the stem and or roots. \n\u2022Your plant is deprived of light and water when it is in the box. \n\u2022Therefore it is expected for your plant to look limp and dry as it gets stressed during transit. \n\u2022It may take 1-2 weeks for your plant to acclimate to its new environment.\n\u2022Also, Plants usually bounce back quick though once watered and placed in indirect sunlight/partial  shade.\n\n\u2022While a General Care Guide is in this listing, it is your responsibility to do your own research on how to properly take care of the plant that you are buying.\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udeb4 TRACKING UPDATE *\n\u2022Please contact the carrier directly for ALL questions regarding the status of your shipment. \n\u2022I provide tracking numbers prior to shipping. \n\n\n\ud83e\udeb4Please inspect your plant as soon as it is delivered and if there is any issue with the order, contact me within 24 HRS\u2014 with clear images showing the issue... and I will do my best to make you happy! \n\n\n\n\ud83e\udeb4Satisfaction is Guaranteed, Please contact me with any concerns or questions, I am here to help... and thank you so much for visiting my shop. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n\n\n*BY PURCHASING THIS PLANT YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE ABOVE TERMS*\n\n\n\n            \ud83c\udf3aLiz @ CaliPlantCo\ud83c\udf3a",

You send me photos of your space, your agricultural zone and soil type, and your hopes and dreams for your garden, and I will give you a PDF plan for how to make it happen. You will get a plant map and a mock up of the plants in your space, plus a shopping list.\n\nThis listing is for &quot;One Area&quot; such as your front yard or your side yard.

        description:
          "Gymnocalycium damsii ssp. evae var. boosii, 6 plants\n\nThe first picture shows the plants you will receive. They are shown in a 4&quot; pot, but may be shipped bare root. \nOther images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect.\n\nGymnocalycium damsii is one of the easiest cacti to grow. Plant in a loose, fertile soil mix, and water and feed regularly during the growing season with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example: perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria (black or red volcanic gravel and sand), pumice, topsoil and/or calcined clay products such as Turface. The rest can be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost or commercial cactus potting mix. The organic ingredients can help maintain a slightly acidic pH balance which is desirable for this genus. This cactus prefers bright, but filtered or diffused sunlight, and some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to at least 15\u00b0F if kept dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nYou can pot these seedlings together in a 3&quot;-4&quot; pot or you can separate them and pot individually or in smaller groups, in which case I would recommend a 2&quot; pot. After potting do not water for 7-10 days to allow roots to heal since unhealed wet roots are susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. Keep young seedlings in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Gymnocalyciums do best in filtered or diffused sunlight. \n\nCacti are shipped using the most appropriate and protective packaging. Occasionally, they may suffer small nicks or broken spines but will heal as they grow and you likely won\u2019t remember where the damage was. After potting and a 7-10-day rest period to let roots heal, watering and feeding will help restore them to their normal vibrance and robustness.",

        description:
          "Bay Leaf Plant (Laurus noblis) is a hearty plant that prefers full to partial sun, does well in warm weathers. Bay leaf is a Mediterranean native plant that is used commonly for culinary purposes. The dried bay leaf can be added to stews or other foods for a earthy, peppery taste. This plant will require moderate pruning to keep a smaller height, otherwise the bay leaf plant can grow tall to reach 23 ft at full maturity if not pruned or kept as a hedge or in a container. would highly recommend transplanting these plants into larger pots at least one gallon pot depth if not 2 gallon pot depth within 3 months of receiving your plant.  \n\n*These are live plants and will vary, but each plant will be a fully rooted Bayleaf plant. These have more roots than the 2 inch listed.*\n\nPlease see the shop homepage for our Eco-friendly promise.",

          "Ficus Microcarpa, Chinese banyan, Live House Plant, Bonsai Plant, Plant Gift, Ships in 4&quot; or 6&quot; Pot",
        description:
          "You will receive one established and healthy Ficus Microcarpa, commonly called &quot;Chinese banyan&quot;, in its 4&quot; or 6&quot; nursery pot with soil. The 4&quot; size option averages 8&quot; high by 5&quot; wide in its nursery pot when shipped. The 6&quot; size option averages 12&quot; tall by 6&quot; wide in its nursery pot when shipped. Each plant is unique and has a different whimsical and sculptural look to its trunk. \n\nLight \n\nThe Ficus microcarpa will thrive in medium to bright indirect light. Avoid lighting extremes, such as direct sun and dark corners. Direct sunlight can burn these plants, causing damage to the foliage.\n\nWater and Soil \n\nFicus microcarpa like to be kept evenly moist. These plants do not like their soil to dry out, and like most all plants, are susceptible to root rot if their soil remains too wet or soggy. This plant should be watered once the top layer of the soil becomes dry. Amending a standard well-draining potting soil with peat moss will help to keep your plants roots evenly moist, while the addition of perlite will ensure that proper drainage and root aeration are provided. \n\nTemperature and Humidity \n\nThis plant prefers room temperatures between 60 degrees F and 85 degrees F. Temperatures shouldn\u2019t drop below 60 degrees as this could damage the foliage. Cold, drafty areas should be avoided. The Ficus microcarpa prefers moderate to high humidity levels. If your home is on the drier side, misting the plant a few times a week will provide humidity.\n\nWinter Shipping Guide & Heat Packs\n\nWe are happy to provide tropical houseplants to plant lovers across the country year-round from South Carolina, where we experience a relatively mild climate throughout the year. However, we regularly ship to areas with temperature extremes. The majority of our packages are shipped via USPS, and we have found that they do an excellent job of keeping their parcels protected from extreme temperatures.\n\nOur secure packaging method provides an insulated cocoon for the plant, which offers a degree of protection against temperature extremes. If you have concerns about low temperatures, we also offer multiple heat pack options. We recommend adding a heat pack to your order when shipping live plants during winter months and during times of extreme weather across the country. You can find these heat packs in our shop, or directly from this listing - https://www.etsy.com/listing/733416370/heat-pack-for-live-plant-shipments-72\n\nWhen a heat pack is purchased, we guarantee shipments of live plants during winter months or during periods of extreme weather throughout the country from cold damage. However, we always recommend that someone is available on the day of delivery to retrieve the package from your mailbox or doorstep as this is when it is most likely to be exposed to extreme temperatures. For this reason, we require that any cold damage claims be made within 2 hours of delivery. Simply send us over photos as soon as you have unpackaged your order and we will gladly take care of any issues. \n\nIf you have any questions regarding heat packs, or concerns regarding temperatures, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nHappy & Healthy Guarantee \n\nWe take extreme care when packaging and shipping all of our live plants to ensure you receive a happy, healthy plant.\n\nWe guarantee that the plant you receive will be in good and healthy condition. However, we cannot guarantee shipments of live plants during winter months or periods of extreme weather throughout the country if a heat pack is not purchased separately. See our &quot;Cold Weather Shipping & Heat Packs&quot; section above.\n\nLive plants can become droopy or fatigued during shipping. We recommend unpackaging your plant as soon as possible upon delivery and placing it in indirect light. Once your plant has had a few hours to adjust to its new environment you can place it in proper light conditions and begin watering it according to the included Care Guide. Do your best to refrain from re-potting your new plant for at least 5-7 days. This will help avoid any additional stress on the plant. We typically recommend leaving plants in their nursery pots until you see signs of roots poking through the drainage holes at the base of the pot.  \n\nWhen plants are shipped, some leaves may experience small kinks or minimal damage. Rest assured that this is only cosmetic and will not affect the health of the plant. \n\nIf for any reason you are not satisfied with the condition that your plant arrives in, please let us know as soon as possible or within a maximum of 5 days of receiving your order so we can take the steps to correct this. All plants must still be in original nursery pots to be eligible for our Happy & Healthy Guarantee. You and your plants happiness are very important to us so please reach out to us as soon as you see any signs of issues.",

          "Gymnocalycium damsii ssp. evae var. boosii, 6 plants\n\nThe first picture shows the plants you will receive. They are shown in a 4&quot; pot, but may be shipped bare root. \nOther images show the mature plant as well as the kind of flowers you can expect.\n\nGymnocalycium damsii is one of the easiest cacti to grow. Plant in a loose, fertile soil mix, and water and feed regularly during the growing season with a quarter-strength, balanced fertilizer. Most of the mix should be inorganic, for example: perlite, small gravel, coarse sand, scoria (black or red volcanic gravel and sand), pumice, topsoil and/or calcined clay products such as Turface. The rest can be up to 25% organic ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, or well-rotted compost or commercial cactus potting mix. The organic ingredients can help maintain a slightly acidic pH balance which is desirable for this genus. This cactus prefers bright, but filtered or diffused sunlight, and some light shade is okay, particularly on hot summer afternoons. It can withstand temperatures down to at least 15\u00b0F if kept dry and cool during winter dormancy.\n\nYou can pot these seedlings together in a 3&quot;-4&quot; pot or you can separate them and pot individually or in smaller groups, in which case I would recommend a 2&quot; pot. After potting do not water for 7-10 days to allow roots to heal since unhealed wet roots are susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. Keep young seedlings in a shady spot during that time, not in direct sun. Gymnocalyciums do best in filtered or diffused sunlight. \n\nCacti are shipped using the most appropriate and protective packaging. Occasionally, they may suffer small nicks or broken spines but will heal as they grow and you likely won\u2019t remember where the damage was. After potting and a 7-10-day rest period to let roots heal, watering and feeding will help restore them to their normal vibrance and robustness.",
